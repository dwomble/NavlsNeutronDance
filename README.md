# Navl's Neutron Dancer

This plugin's purpose is to make neutron jumping easier by plotting a route using [Spansh](https://www.spansh.co.uk/plotter) within EDMC and automatically copying the next waypoint in that route to your clipboard.

The goal of this fork is support for the new 6x overcharge of the Caspian and a cleaner UI.

## Installation

- Open your EDMC plugins folder - in EDMC settings, select "Plugins" tab, click the "Open" button.
- Create a folder inside the plugins folder and call it whatever you want, **NeutronDancer** for instance
- Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/dwomble/EDMC-NeutronDancer/releases/latest) and unzip it.
- Open the folder you created and put all the files and folders you extracted inside
- Restart EDMC

## Usage

Currently you can only plot a route directly from EDMC by clicking the "do the neutron dance" button.

Once your route is plotted, and every time you reach a waypoint, the next one is automatically copied to your clipboard.

You just need to go to your Galaxy Map and paste it and click plot route.

If for some reason, your clipboard should be empty or containing other stuff that you copied yourself, just click on the **System Name** button, and the waypoint will be copied again to your clipboard.

If you close EDMC, the plugin will save your progress. The next time you run EDMC, it will start back where you stopped.
